# Used Car Price Prediction  

* Understand the business case study

* Create Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models

* Import key Python libraries, dataset, and perform Exploratory Data Analysis like removing missing values, replacing characters, etc.

* Perform interactive data visualization using Seaborn and Plotly and WordCloud

* Prepare the data to increase the predictive power of Machine Learning models by One-Hot Encoding, Feature dropping, and Train/Test Split

* Build and train Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost models to predict the price of the used cars

* Calculate Regression Metrics from the trained models and compare the accuracy score
